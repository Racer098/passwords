                    </figure>
                    <p>Let’s start off with the basics! When you register for a website, your password is put through a one-way algorithm called a hash-function That way no one knows what your password is except you. The issue is when these services or websites get pwned, or hacked, it’s common to find your username with your password’s hash publicly available. Once a hacker or anyone else obtains these hashes, they can use tools like John the Ripper, oclHashcat, and other tools to crack the hashes and retrieve the actual password.<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Tips and Tricks</h2>
                    <p><br>The first golden rule of passwords is to use good, secure passwords for every website you visit, making it harder to brute-force. ]If you are using the word red, try to replace the e with a 3, this is a very simple tip that can go a long way with longer passwords. You should be using both lower and uppercase letters, including symbols, numbers within the password, and making it as random as you possibly can. The longer the password the better, I’d recommend having at the very least 12 digits, and working your way up to the dozens if you can.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/about-bg.jpg">
                    <p><br>The other golden rule is to never use the same password twice. Let’s say Adobe got hacked and your email and password are posted online. If your email account uses the same password that you used for Adobe, a person now has your email address, as well as the password to your account. Giving them access to your email where they could possibly get access to other accounts.<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Concluding&nbsp;</h2>
                    <p><br>Another form of verification is ALP, or Android lock patterns. In short, avoid these. At the passwords-con conference in 2015, researchers reported that people often used the first letter of their first name, and that people tended to use the dots in the middle and not in the 4 corners. On top of this, security researchers at the US Naval Academy and the University of Maryland Baltimore County published a study showing an observer can visually pick up and then reproduce an Android unlock pattern with relative ease. About two of every three observers successfully recreated a pattern from five or six feet away after a single viewing.<br><br></p><a href="#"></a>
